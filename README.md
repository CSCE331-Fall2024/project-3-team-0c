## Overview Details

Opening the app, users are first met with a weather API that displays real-time information. Additionally, users can opt to choose a different language than English to navigate the website with. There will be various paths the user can take based on their end-goal. There are options to Start an Order for a customer, View the Menu Board for the customer, Reviews for the customer, and Log in Manager/Cashier for employees. Routing to the next respective page, users can perform actions to meet their needs. Customers can submit an order using an easily navigatable interface that pushes orders to the backend while also being alerted of various allergies that they might not be aware of. They can also view a noninteractive menu board that changes on a timer for their ease of decision-making. Furthermore, they can view various reviews and leave reviews on diffferent menu items based on customer experience. As for employees, cashiers can easily create and submit orders for customers in a single page that condenses the menu for speedy and efficient checkout. Managers can view reports and interact with the database in a simple and efficient manner.
